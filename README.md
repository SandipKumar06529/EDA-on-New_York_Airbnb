 EDA-on-New_York_Airbnb


This project dives into Airbnb listings in New York City, exploring key trends around pricing, room types, and neighborhood popularity. The analysis uses a Jupyter Notebook with Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. Whether you're an Airbnb host, a data enthusiast, or just curious about the rental market in NYC, these insights can help shed light on what affects listing performance.

 Project Overview
For this analysis, we focused on three main datasets:
1. Listings Data: Detailed information on each Airbnb listing, covering everything from price and room type to amenities and location.
2. Calendar Data: Daily availability and pricing details for each listing.
3. Reviews Data: Customer feedback, which helps us see how guests feel about their stays.

 How We Analyzed the Data
All the analysis is done in a Jupyter Notebook, covering:
- Data Cleaning: We handled missing values, adjusted data types, removed duplicates, and filtered out extreme outliers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using visualizations to dig into patterns and relationships within the data.

 Key Areas of Focus
Our analysis looked at a few main factors that influence how listings perform:
- Price Distribution: We explored how prices vary across listings and neighborhoods.
- Room Type Popularity: We examined which room types (Entire home, Private room, etc.) are the most popular.
- Neighborhood Trends: We looked at price differences across neighborhoods, highlighting areas with higher rates.
- Popularity vs. Pricing: We checked if the number of reviews is linked to listing price, giving us clues about guest preferences.

 What We Found
Here are a few takeaways from the analysis:
- Pricing Trends: Most listings are under $200, but some neighborhoods have a premium price tag.
- Room Type Preferences: Entire homes and private rooms are the most popular, showing guestsâ€™ preference for privacy.
- Neighborhood Demand: Prices change a lot depending on the neighborhood, which suggests location is a big factor in setting rates.
- Correlation Insights: We found some interesting links between availability, reviews, room type, and price, helping to explain what drives listing popularity.

 Visuals
To bring the data to life, we used:
- Histograms to show how prices are distributed.
- Pie charts to illustrate room type popularity.
- Boxplots and count plots to look at trends in different neighborhoods.
- Scatter plots to explore the link between price and number of reviews.
- Heatmaps to show correlations among key metrics.

 Recommendations
This EDA opens up lots of possibilities for further analysis:
- Building a model to predict listing prices based on room type, location, and other factors.
- Looking more deeply at guest reviews to understand their preferences.
- Giving Airbnb hosts tips on pricing and optimizing listings based on these trends.
