# New York Airbnb Data Analysis

This project explores Airbnb listings in New York City, focusing on trends related to pricing, room types, and neighborhood popularity. The analysis uses a Jupyter Notebook with Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The insights gained are valuable for Airbnb hosts, data enthusiasts, and anyone interested in understanding the dynamics of the NYC rental market.

## Project Overview
The analysis draws on three main datasets:
1. Listings Data: Detailed information on each Airbnb listing, covering aspects such as price, room type, amenities, and location.
2. Calendar Data: Daily availability and pricing details for each listing.
3. Reviews Data: Customer feedback, providing insights into guest satisfaction and listing popularity.

## Analysis Approach
The Jupyter Notebook follows these main steps:
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, adjusting data types, removing duplicates, and filtering out extreme outliers.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using visualizations to reveal patterns and relationships within the data.

## Key Areas of Focus
Several key factors influencing listing performance were explored:
- Price Distribution: Understanding how prices vary across listings and neighborhoods.
- Room Type Popularity: Examining the prevalence of different room types, such as Entire home, Private room, etc.
- Neighborhood Trends: Analyzing price differences across neighborhoods to identify areas with higher rental rates.
- Popularity vs. Pricing: Investigating the relationship between the number of reviews and listing price, providing insight into guest preferences.

## Findings
Key observations from the analysis include:
- Pricing Trends: Most listings are priced under $200, but certain neighborhoods command premium rates.
- Room Type Preferences: Entire homes and private rooms are the most common, reflecting guest preferences for privacy.
- Neighborhood Demand: Prices vary significantly by neighborhood, showing location as a major factor in pricing.
- Correlation Insights: Relationships between availability, reviews, room type, and price suggest factors influencing listing performance.

## Visualizations
Several types of visualizations bring out trends in the data:
- Histograms illustrate price distribution across listings.
- Pie charts depict the proportions of room types.
- Boxplots and count plots showcase neighborhood-specific insights.
- Scatter plots analyze the relationship between price and number of reviews.
- Heatmaps highlight correlations among key metrics.

## Recommendations
This EDA sets the stage for further analysis, such as:
- Building predictive models to estimate listing prices based on room type, location, and other factors.
- Conducting deeper analysis on review patterns to understand guest preferences.
- Offering insights for Airbnb hosts on optimizing pricing and listing features based on trends.
